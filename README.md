# Explanation

A lot of what you will see on my Github is side projects that I work on outside of work. I have a large interest in Discord bots, and also playing with cloud platforms. My Github repositories provide a very good timeline of how I have progressed as a developer, and that is why I choose to leave some of my older ones, so there is evidence of growth and transformation!
